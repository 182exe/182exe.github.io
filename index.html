Yo! If you're reading this, then congratulations! You've found the source code of this webpage.
I'm not very good at coding, so please keep that in mind if you are here to steal stuff.
I can't stop you, so I'll just warn you that there are better places to steal from.

Enjoy your time here!

        <p>This is 182exe Online, a place for me (182exe) to post things online and for you to try them out!. Pretty simple, right?</p>
    </section>
    <section id="about">
        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>182exe is an internet user who does a lot of different things. He likes to create stuff and dislikes talking about himself in 3rd person. Here is a short list of things that 182exe does:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plays Minecraft</li>
            <li>Makes pixel art</li>
            <li>Makes Minecraft resourcepacks & skins</li>
            <li>Creates content on Youtube</li>
            <li>Talks a lot on Discord</li>
            <li>Codes basic things (such as this site!)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyways, I'm basically just a person who likes to learn new things and get new skills.</p>

    <section id="links">
        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>Here, you can find links to 182exe's online profiles. Follow me, or else I follow you home.</p>
        <subsection>
            <h1>Youtube</h1>
            <p>I post Minecraft related content on two different channels. The first channel, 182exe, has more effort content, while 182jar has still-entertaining content with a slightly different style than the main channel</p>
            <button onclick="openLink(0)">Main Channel</button>

        <subsection>
            <h1>Discord</h1>

        <subsection>
            <h1>Minecraft & NameMC</h1>
            <p>This is what I do for fun, so if you see me in-game, then say <b>hi!</b> My main account's username is <b>182exe</b> and my alt account is <b>Resourcepac</b>! If you see me in-game, say hi! I also have two NameMC profiles. If you are a NameMC user, then stop by and maybe drop a follow! I make skins sometimes, so those are there too.</p>
